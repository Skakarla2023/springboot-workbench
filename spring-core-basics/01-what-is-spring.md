# 🍁 Spring 

- Spring is a Java framework that helps developers build clean, efficient, secure, and scalable backend applications.
- It helps you:
  - Create APIs
  - Connect to databases
  - Handle security (login, tokens, roles)
  - Manage objects easily (without new-ing everywhere)
  - Build enterprise-level applications


## 🌱 Why do we need Spring?

1. Reduces Boilerplate Code
2. Helps Manage Objects (IoC & DI)
3. Easy Integration
4. Scalable and Enterprise Ready
5. Huge Ecosystem

## 🌱 How is Spring Used in Real Life?

### ✔ 1. Building REST APIs

#### Example:

- Login API
- Register API
- Product listing API
- Payment API

Spring Boot + Spring MVC is used everywhere for API development.

### ✔ 2. Backend for Web & Mobile Apps

- Apps like:

  1. Swiggy
  2. Zomato
  3. Amazon
  4. Banking apps
  5. Ride-sharing apps

- All need backend services that handle:

  - User data
  - Orders
  - Payments
  - Notifications

- Many of these are built using Spring Boot

### ✔ 3. Connecting to Databases & Performing CRUD

- Real-life apps need to store:

  - Users
  - Orders
  - Products
  - Payments

- Spring Data JPA helps you do:

  - save()
  - update()
  - delete()
  - fetch()

- …without writing SQL manually.

### ✔ 5. Microservices Architecture

- Companies like:

  - Netflix
  - Uber
  - Amazon

- Use Spring Boot + Spring Cloud to break large apps into small services:

  - User service
  - Order service
  - Payment service
  - Inventory service

- Each microservice runs independently.

### ✔ 6. Enterprise Applications (Banking, Healthcare, Finance)

- Spring is widely used in:

  - Banks (HDFC, ICICI, SBI backends use Java/Spring)
  - Insurance
  - Fintech
  - Billing systems
  - Ticketing systems

- Because Spring is:

  - Fast
  - Secure
  - Stable
  - Scalable
